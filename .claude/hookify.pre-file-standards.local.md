## 📝 Code Standards Check

Before writing/editing code:
- **NO** demo pages or example implementations
- **NO** simulations or stub code
- **NO** mock implementations
- **NO** wrapper solutions or unnecessary abstractions
- **NO** surprise features beyond what was asked

**Validation Requirements:**
- 🔍 All code verified with **DeepWiki** and/or **WebFetch**
- ✅ Further validated with **Context7**
- ❓ Questions/uncertainties → **Ask DeepWiki**
- ⚠️ Assumptions validated or corrected by **Ask DeepWiki**

**⚠️ Non-compliance will result in blocking hooks.**

Write clean, production-ready, by-the-book code only.
