## ⚡ Implementation Standards Reminder

**All implementations must be:**
- By the book - follow established patterns, no custom inventions
- Clean and straightforward - no wrapper solutions or unnecessary abstractions
- Minimal complexity - only what's needed, nothing more

**Expressly FORBIDDEN:**
- ❌ Demo pages
- ❌ Simulations
- ❌ Stubs
- ❌ Mock code
- ❌ Surprise features
- ❌ Unnecessary customizations

**Validation Requirements:**
- 🔍 All code must be verified with **DeepWiki** and/or **WebFetch**
- ✅ Further validate with **Context7**
- ❓ All questions and uncertainties → **Ask DeepWiki**
- ⚠️ All assumptions must be validated or corrected by **Ask DeepWiki**

**⚠️ Failure to adhere to these standards will result in blocking hooks.**

**Write production-ready code only.**
